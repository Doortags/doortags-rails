			%h1 How DoorTags works
		.span4.noLeft
			%h2 1. Set up tag and location
			%p Set up your tag and give it a location name online with whatever you like. "Das Baus Haus," "Tony's crib," and "The Batcave" are all acceptable location names.
		.span4 
			%h2 2. Get notified
			%p When someone puts their smartphone against the NFC tag, we send you a message that they are there. We also give them the ability to send you quick text
		.span4	
			%h2 3. Stay number anonymous
			%p We understand the importance of privacy. People do not get your number when they contact you, but they have the option of sending you their number, so you can contact them back. Setting the tags make them read-only so others cannot hijack your tags.

	%p The amount of locations you can set up is only limited by the the number of NFC tags you have. Customize each tag with an random name.
